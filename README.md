# Svalinn Android

**WARNING: Under development. Libraries right now target the Rinkeby test network. Switching to mainnet (or any other ethereum network) can be done by the user but it's its responsibility in doing so.**

### Goal

This is a collection of libraries that should make development of apps that interact with Ethereum easier. **Some functionality should be moved to [Kethereum](https://github.com/walleth/kethereum)**
